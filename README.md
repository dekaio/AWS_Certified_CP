# 5. AWS Gobal Infrastructures: Where does all this cloud computing run?
  69 Availability zones, 22 Geographic regions around the world with way more edge locations than the AZs.   
    1. Regions: Physical location (Geographically distinct) in the world with multiple availability zones. Every region is physically isolated from and independent of evry other region in terms of location, power, water supply.    
  Each region has atleast two AZs.   
  AWS largest region is US-EAST.   
  Services almost alwyas become available first in US-EAST.   
  Not all services are available in all regions.   
  US-EAST-1 is the region where you see all your billing information.   
  Availability zones: One or more discrete data centers
  Edge location: Datacenter owned by a trusted partner of AWS.
